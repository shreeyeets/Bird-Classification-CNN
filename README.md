| No Augmentation                | No                | None                     | XX.X                    |
| Augmentation with Flip        | Yes               | None                     | XX.X                    |
| Augmentation + Dropout        | Yes               | Dropout (0.5)           | XX.X                    |
| Augmentation + L2 Regularization | Yes               | L2 (Î» = 0.001)          | XX.X                    |

These techniques significantly impacted the model's performance, demonstrating the importance of data augmentation and regularization in preventing overfitting.

## Class Activation Maps (CAM)

Visualizations of Class Activation Maps (CAM) were created for each class, providing insights into which regions of the images the model focuses on when making predictions. These visualizations help in understanding model behavior and interpreting its decisions.
